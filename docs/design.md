## The News Feed Project
By: Aaron Wang, Sujay Bhilegalkar, Rishi Mantri, Sam Bisaria

### Overview:
Computer Science Organizations across campus are divided into disparate silos, with news split across hard-to-access channels from Slack, Discord, Instagram, GroupMe and innumerable other platforms. Students are often interested in news from all or many of these sources, but may struggle to keep up-to-date. A news feed on the CSXL would aggregate all this information and provide it to students. 

### Key Personas:
- Gary Guest is a member of the public visiting the site, they can only see posts
- Sally Student is a typical student with no permissions besides viewing and comment/reacting to posts.
- Emily Executive is a office/representative of their organization who can do everything Sally Student can do and draft, make, and edit their posts
- Lance Leader is the leader of their organization (or a professor) who can grant 3 users executive permissions on their behalf and can do everything Emily Executive can do
- Ronda Root is the administrator of the website and will be able to post to any channel and mark posts as announcements

### User Stories

### Wireframes / Mockups: 
Include rough wireframes of your featureâ€™s user interfaces for the most critical user stories, along with brief descriptions of what is going on. These can be hand-drawn, made in PowerPoint/KeyNote, or created with a tool like Figma. To see an example of a detailed wireframe Kris made this summer before building the drop-in feature, see this Figma board. You will notice the final implementation is not 1:1 with the original wireframe!


Individuals can see all the list of all the news articles that have been published.

They can click on an individual news article and see it in full length. Comments are at the bottom and Sally student can make a comment.
