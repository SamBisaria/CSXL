1. Sample data in the backend mainly consisted of using 1560/docs to test if the different, get, post, and other requests were working properly and communicating with the database. Some consisted of running unit tests to see if the backend requests would provide the correct info. The news entity along with the services get_drafts and add_post, and finally the APIs get_drafts and create drafts were mainly what were used in the backend to relate to the front end for our stories here. The stories we did this time consisted of being able to fill out a form that creates a draft for a post and saves it to the database. And, the second story, is being able to view and alter the drafts on the news form page. 

2. The main relationships in the database relevant to sprint 1 are those between users and drafts, which is one to many. Each user that can make posts has the ability to make multiple drafts which can eventually become posts. This led to the news model and the creation of services that, when looking at drafts, specifically filter out for posts that don't have the same user id. This is obviously not the same for posts in general. 

3. We decided to do twod stories involving the creation of drafts and being able to see drafts. The reason we did this over stories like viewing the news page or allowing permissions is that the ability to make drafts and view them are the key parts involved in actually creating the news articles that will be posted. From there, posting the news is simply publishing it. Making announcements is simply ordering. Finally, permissions would be useless without the creation or editing of posts being possible. 

4. They need to understand the post/news entity on the backend, the backend news services and api files. Then on the front end they need to understand the news folder, with the widgets inside, the news-form, and the news-draft folders. The front end news-form and news-draft contain the main logic for the form that one uses to make news posts and the place where ones drafts show up. The news folder in the frontend contains the code for the actual front news page that shows the articles and announcements. This is also where the widgets are. On the backend the entities are obvious in that they allow the database to communicate with the python backend. The services are also self-explanatory in that they query for specific data from the database, and the APIs file simply has APIs that one can use on the front end to access data that is requested by the backend services.
